Fluff the Penguin 2: Revenge of Big Boy

This is a sequel to a previous I made in Spring 2019 during my Spring
term in the University of Oregon. This was made with the concept of
learning new controls and enemy behavior, which was a challenge
since I needed to make a transition between different controls
and movement. While it does let use the old assets I had, making
new assets was a huge challenge since I needed to make them under
the concepts and transitions I had in mind.

Overall, it turned out great. It's currently made in WebGL, but
Firefox seems to have made some precaution about local files.

I recommend using Firefox, where you go to "about:config" and
make "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" set to false.

Also set "webgl.force-enabled" and "layers.acceleration.force-enabled"
set to true.
