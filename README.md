# Fluff the Penguin 2: Revenge of Big Boy

This game is a sequel to my old group game project, Fluff the Penguin.
While it still has some of the base mechanics in the previous one,
it adds weapons to choose at the start, new controls and mechanics,
and new stages for Fluff to go through.

I recommend FireFox and Microsoft Edge to play this.

If it doesn't work, add "index.html" at the end.
